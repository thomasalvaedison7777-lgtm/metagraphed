# Contributing to Metagraphed

Metagraphed is the Bittensor subnet integration registry — every subnet, metagraphed. This is the backend: a Cloudflare Worker API plus Node build scripts. **JSON Schema is the canonical contract** → OpenAPI → typed clients. Generated artifacts under `public/metagraph/` are projections of reviewed source, never hand-authored truth.

Live: [metagraph.sh](https://metagraph.sh) · API [api.metagraph.sh](https://api.metagraph.sh) · License AGPL-3.0 (Apache-2.0 client SDKs)

Two kinds of contribution, two paths:

- **Code / schema changes** → normal feature PR, run the gates below.
- **Community data** → add a surface to one subnet file, see [Community submissions](#community-submissions).

## Setup & gates

Use Node 22.

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run validate
npm run build
```

`npm run validate` runs schema, API, and OpenAPI checks. For a full local data pipeline run, use `npm run pipeline:check`. Match focused checks to what you touch (`npm run validate:schemas`, `validate:api`, `validate:openapi`, `worker:test`) rather than running everything.

## Schema-first rule

The contract is generated, so you never edit it by hand:

1. Edit the source under `schemas/` or `schemas/components/`.
2. Run `npm run build` to regenerate `openapi.json` and the types/clients.
3. **Commit the regenerated artifacts in the same PR.**

Skipping the rebuild trips `validate:contract-drift` in CI. Schemas are the source of truth; everything downstream follows.

## Don't hand-bump version fields

These are bumped automatically after your PR merges — leave them alone:

- `packages/client/package.json`'s `"version"`.
- `src/mcp-server.mjs`'s `MCP_SERVER_VERSION` and the matching `"version"` in `server.json`.

CI never requires you to bump these yourself — a PR that changes the contract or adds an MCP tool is valid without touching either. Bumping one of them in your own PR doesn't help and risks a version conflict with the automation's own follow-up PR; expect it to be closed with a request to resubmit without that edit.

## Where to start

- **Enrich a subnet** (the best first PR) — we track one scoped task per subnet under the [surface-enrichment epic #427](https://github.com/JSONbored/metagraphed/issues/427). Browse [`good first issue`](https://github.com/JSONbored/metagraphed/labels/good%20first%20issue) + [`help wanted`](https://github.com/JSONbored/metagraphed/labels/help%20wanted): pick a subnet, find its real public API / OpenAPI / data artifact, and add it as a surface on the subnet's file ([Community submissions](#community-submissions) below). Each issue links the `surface:add` command and flags `subnet:new` when the subnet file does not exist yet.
- **Data gaps** — generate the current curation queue: `npm run curation:brief` (add `-- --limit 20` for more, `-- --json` for machine-readable). Start with profile-light subnets: directory-only entries, missing websites or source repos, public APIs with no OpenAPI metadata yet. See [`docs/curation-playbook.md`](docs/curation-playbook.md).

## Community submissions

Surfaces live in **one file per subnet**: `registry/subnets/<slug>.json` → its `surfaces[]` array. A community contribution **adds a surface to that one file** — `npm run surface:add` writes it with `authority: "community"` and `review.state: "community-submitted"`. If the subnet has no manifest yet, scaffold that one subnet file first with `npm run subnet:new`, then add the surface to the same file. There is no per-surface candidate file anymore (recreating `registry/candidates/community/*.json` is rejected by CI), so you can't farm one surface per PR: **one subnet = one file = one PR.**

> Change **only** the one `registry/subnets/<slug>.json` — no generated artifacts. For an existing subnet manifest, that means appending your community surface without changing top-level subnet metadata. For a missing subnet manifest, the required `subnet:new` scaffold fields are expected in the new file. First-time provider? Pass `--provider-name` + `--provider-url` and `surface:add` scaffolds the `registry/providers/<slug>.json` stub for you in the same PR; provider identity still gets reviewed before it's trusted.

> **Plagiarism is not tolerated.** Copying another contributor's PR, surface, or work and submitting it as your own — including duplicated or lightly reworded copies filed under a different account — is a hard violation. Don't copy others to farm Gittensor rewards: anyone attempting to cheat or copy for gain is **permanently blocked from contributing across all of our repositories**. See [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

> A linked, currently-open issue is required on every PR — filing your own issue and then opening a PR that resolves it is welcome and the normal path, but a PR with no linked issue, or one linked to an issue that's already closed, is automatically closed before its content is even scored. What is against policy is **using more than one account you control (alt / sock-puppet accounts) — e.g. one account opening issues for another to "resolve" — to inflate contribution credit**, along with manufacturing low-value/slop issues and bulk point-chasing surface PRs. Farmed work earns no linked-issue bonus, and repeat or any confirmed multi-account farming is closed on sight and blocked. Enforcement is proportional; the full ladder is in [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Add a surface locally — three steps:

```bash
# 1. Find the provider slug for the team/operator behind this surface.
npm run providers:list

# 2. Append the surface to the subnet's file with a REAL --provider slug.
#    Debut provider? Add --provider-name + --provider-url and surface:add also
#    scaffolds registry/providers/<slug>.json so the PR validates in one shot.
npm run surface:add -- \
  --netuid 7 --kind docs \
  --url https://docs.example.com \
  --source-url https://github.com/example/project \
  --provider <provider-slug> --submitted-by <github-login> --write
  # debut provider: --provider-name "Example Team" --provider-url https://example.com

# 3. Check it before pushing — a fast local pre-check (schema + provider slug +
#    review-state + real subnet name) without the full build (CI runs full validate).
npm run validate:surface -- registry/subnets/<slug>.json
```

> New subnet with no file yet? `npm run subnet:new -- --netuid <n> --name "<Real Name>" --write` first — a real `--name` is required (placeholder on-chain identities like "Team TBC" are rejected) — then add your surface to it.

A good surface PR is small: one public `url`, one `source_url` proving the claim, the right `kind`, all on the subnet's single file. Auto-review kinds: `docs`, `website`, `source-repo`, `dashboard`, `openapi`, `subnet-api`, `sse`, `data-artifact`, `sdk`, `example`.

**Higher-trust application surfaces** (authenticated or paid APIs, unknown providers, identity disputes) are welcome too — the autonomous reviewer scrutinizes identity/evidence harder and, when in doubt, closes or escalates rather than merging. Make the proof airtight (an independent `source_url` proving ownership). Base-layer `subtensor-rpc`/`subtensor-wss`/`archive` endpoints are maintainer-curated network infrastructure served through the endpoint lane, not contributor subnet surfaces.

**Hard boundaries:**

- Health, uptime, latency, incidents, and pool eligibility are **probe-derived only** — never hand-set them (or a surface's `verification`). The build's prober owns them.
- No secrets, PATs, wallet paths, private URLs, or validator-local data.
- Don't invent API/status surfaces a subnet doesn't publish.
- Schema-valid ≠ accepted. The review gate makes the final call.

**Accepted vs rejected at a glance** — the visible checklist (the final merge decision is the review gate's):

| ✅ Tends to get accepted                                                                                                                                                     | ❌ Gets closed / routed to manual                                                                    |

Callable surface with documented limits? Add an optional structured `rate_limit` — `{ requests, window, burst?, scope?, cost_notes? }` (`requests` + `window` required) — so agents and SDKs can pace calls. It's integration-only: metagraphed never enforces it and it doesn't feed completeness.

## Pull requests

- Short and focused, Conventional Commit-style titles.
- Include the validation commands you ran in the PR body.
- No local paths, machine-specific setup, env dumps, or private notes.
- Frontend/UI work lives at `apps/ui/` in this same repo (folded in from the former metagraphed-ui repo via monorepo consolidation). Any PR touching visual output (routes, components, styles) requires a before/after screenshot table in the PR body and is always held for manual review, regardless of AI-review confidence — see the `metagraphed` skill's Path C for the full contract. A PR confined to `apps/ui`'s data/hooks layer or tests, with no visual change, follows the normal one-shot gate.

## How reviews work

**Timing is typical, not an SLA.** When the gittensory maintainer agent is operating, most PRs are reviewed and auto-merged or auto-closed within **~1 hour of CI finishing**; when it is paused or under maintenance, manual review **typically takes 24–48 hours, depending on volume**. These are observations, not commitments — reviews happen when they happen.

**One-shot, merge-ready as-is.** We do not request changes on contributor PRs — a PR is merged exactly as it stands or it is closed; there is no "changes requested" back-and-forth. Before CI we rebase your branch onto `main` with a **merge commit**, then review **after** CI completes — so a rebase conflict, or any failing gate (schema, API, OpenAPI, `contract-drift`, or surface validation), closes the PR. Keep to the one-subnet-one-file rule, regenerate artifacts, and make it green before pushing; recover from a close by opening a **fresh, corrected PR**. PRs touching guarded paths (build scripts, the Worker API, CI config) are held for manual review.

**You can have at most 2 open PRs against this repo at a time** — a 3rd is closed on sight. Every automatic close, including this one, comes with a comment from the gate explaining exactly what was wrong so you can fix it in your next PR.

**If we close your PR by mistake, that's on us** — we may reopen or re-review at our discretion as time permits. There is no fixed window, and a fresh PR is usually fastest.

**Don't ask for or chase reviews.** The queue is automated and best-effort, and the gate posts its own status on your PR. Do **not** DM, @-mention, or comment asking for a review or status — it will not speed anything up and **will deprioritize your PR (expect at least 5 days added to its place in the manual queue)**. Persistent pestering (here, Discord, or elsewhere) is a conduct violation and may get the PR closed and the account blocked.

**Scoring and rewards are not ours to grant.** Contribution scoring and any Gittensor rewards are set by the subnet's on-chain hyperparameters and validators, not by this repo. Merging a PR is not a promise of score, ranking, or compensation, and all review decisions are at maintainer discretion and final.
