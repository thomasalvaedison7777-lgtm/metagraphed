// Client-SDK drift gate.
//
// The published `@jsonbored/metagraphed` client is a thin re-export of the
// repo's generated contract (`packages/client/scripts/sync-generated.mjs` copies
// `generated/metagraphed-api.d.ts` + `generated/metagraphed-client.ts` into the
// package on build, and the package tracks `public/metagraph/openapi.json`). But
// release-please versions the `client` component ONLY from changes under
// `packages/client/**` — a contract-only PR (schemas → generated → openapi.json)
// touches none of those, so it opens a `platform`/`python` release PR while the
// client silently stays on its old version and never republishes. The npm
// package then drifts behind the live contract until someone notices.
//
// This gate closes that hole deterministically: on a PR, if any CONTRACT file
// changed versus the merge base BUT `packages/client/package.json` "version" did
// NOT change, fail with a clear remediation message. It is diff-scoped, so a PR
// that touches no contract file never fires — only contract changes are gated.
//
// The reverse case (a contributor manually bumps the version themselves) is
// NOT a failure either -- the post-merge sync-client-version workflow does not
// look at whether the version already moved, only whether a contract file
// changed since its own last bump commit, so a hand-bump here is at best
// redundant and at worst a merge conflict with that auto-opened PR. `main()`
// emits a non-blocking notice for this case; enforcing it against contributor
// PRs (vs. a maintainer's deliberate off-cycle bump) is a judgment call left to
// the Gittensory Gate review, not this deterministic CI gate.
