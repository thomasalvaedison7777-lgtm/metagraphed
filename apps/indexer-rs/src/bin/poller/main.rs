// poller -- consolidated chain-state polling service (metagraphed-infra#136/
// #137). A SIBLING binary to ../main.rs (backfill-rs's historical backfill +
// live-follow, INDEX_MODE=live) in this SAME crate/monorepo location
// (apps/indexer-rs/) -- its own process, its own systemd unit, so a slow or
// misbehaving poll job can never affect the live-follow hot path. Shares the
// subxt#2050-mitigated ChainClient + connect_pg with ../main.rs via
// src/lib.rs rather than forking that connection logic.
//
// Replaces the growing pile of one-off Python systemd jobs under
// roles/data-refresh-cron (metagraph, account-identity, subnet-hyperparams,
// validator-nominators, self-stake, account-balances) with one binary, one
// systemd unit, and an internal async scheduler -- each job runs on its own
// independent tokio interval, in its own `run_loop` (see jobs::subnet_ownership
// for the pattern every job follows), reporting through the shared
// `log_job_outcome` below so every job's ok/failed logging reads the same
// way. A job that decided its own error rate was too high to trust (mirrors
// scripts/fetch-account-balances.py's MAX_ERROR_RATE) should return `Err`
// from its `run`, not a low `written` count.
//
// Each job owns its OWN Postgres connection AND its OWN chain (ChainClient)
// connection -- connected once, kept for the life of the job's loop --
// rather than sharing either across jobs.
//
// Postgres: some jobs (account-balances) need a real transaction
// (`&mut Client`) for a COPY-to-staging + upsert bulk load, matching
// ../main.rs's own `flush()` pattern at indexer scale -- a `&mut` borrow
// can't be shared across concurrently-running job tasks.
//
// Chain: live-verified 2026-07-19 that sharing one ChainClient (one
// underlying WebSocket) across two concurrently-running jobs is a real
// problem, not just a theoretical one -- running subnet-ownership and
// account-balances together, subnet-ownership's own simple single-key
// SubnetOwnerHotkey fetches started hitting the ReconnectingRpcClient's 60s
// request_timeout (each one individually took ~200ms-2.7s in isolation, see
// subnet_ownership.rs's own PERFORMANCE note) -- account-balances' heavy
// concurrent System::Account streaming was starving the shared connection.
// A dedicated WebSocket per job (cheap: each job polls infrequently, these
// are long-lived idle-most-of-the-time connections, not a connection-per-
// request pattern) fully isolates one job's chain-RPC load from another's,
// the same way the per-job Postgres connection isolates writes.
//
// There's deliberately no generic `run_job_loop<F>` scheduler taking an
// arbitrary job closure: stable Rust can't cleanly express "an FnMut that
// returns a future borrowing a per-job `&mut Postgres client`" without
// boxing every future, so each job gets a small (~15-line) `run_loop`
// instead. What's actually worth sharing -- the tick/log/never-crash-the-
// process policy -- lives in `log_job_outcome` below, which every job's
// `run_loop` calls after each tick.
//
// Env:
//   DATABASE_URL                postgres connection (the same sink ../main.rs writes)
//   EVENTS_RPC_URL               chain RPC ws(s) url (default: the public archive)
//   SUBNET_OWNERSHIP_POLL_SECS   how often to re-poll subnet ownership (default 300)
//   POLLER_ONLY                  comma-separated job names (e.g. "subnet-hyperparams")
//                                 to run in isolation -- unset runs every job (the
//                                 normal/production mode). Genuinely useful beyond
//                                 debugging, not just a throwaway test knob: live-tested
//                                 2026-07-19 that running every job concurrently against
//                                 a contended RPC endpoint makes it hard to tell "this
//                                 job has a real bug" from "every job is fighting the
//                                 same connection for bandwidth" -- isolating one job
//                                 removes that confound whenever it matters (this env,
//                                 or a fresh deploy of just one job's worth of changes).
